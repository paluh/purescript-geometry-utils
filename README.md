purescript-geometry-utils
====

Quite usystematic set of utils / types to work with geometrical primitives. Coded to do some actual work. Maybe some day it will be worth publishing...

Currently I'm focusing on plane geometry.

## docs, publishing etc.

If you see this library useful please let me know I can try to find some work to provide some basic docs and publish it...
